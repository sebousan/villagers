  title: A collective force where creativity meets marketing intelligence
  text: Creative agencies are relics of a world that no longer exists. The future
    belongs to brands that unite creative brilliance with operational
    intelligence—where strategy, storytelling, and production move as one. These
    are the brands that act fast, stay consistent across every touchpoint, and
    turn creativity into performance. **Villagers** was built for them.

      title: Born in 2025. Shape over the years
      text: Villagers founder Johann Bernast brought over 15 years of experience
        working with top global agencies such as DDB and BETC in Paris, as well
        as managing in-house brands like Jaeger-LeCoultre in Geneva. Having
        worked both within brands and alongside them, he became convinced that
        the traditional agency / brand relationship needed to be reinvented.
