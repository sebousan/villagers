      text: Villagers founder Johann Bernast brought over 15 years of experience
        working with top global agencies such as DDB and BETC in Paris, as well
        as managing in-house brands like Jaeger-LeCoultre in Geneva. Having
        worked both within brands and alongside them, he became convinced that
        the traditional agency / brand relationship needed to be reinvented.

      every skill, every idea counts.
